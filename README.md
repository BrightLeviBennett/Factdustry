# Factdustry
The repo for my soon to be game 'factdustry', It is not finished yet(and will not be finisehed anytime soon), but enjoy whats here I guess!

P.S. I am using XCode to make this, it is not runable on non-mac/non-xcode devices, please download it from the app store on Apple devices (sorry linux, windows, samsung and android users) :(

P.S.S. If you want to learn more, go to the factdustry wiki [Here](https://factdustry.fandom.com/wiki/Factdustry_Wiki), or my factdustry Trello board [Here](https://trello.com/b/YUkvQWFm/factdustry-trello)


## ----- Dev notes -----

-----==========-----

I upgraded my computer's OS to MacOS 26 (Tahoe), and it may or may not be caused by the changes in the ui that Apple made, or it may be something I did, but as of commit (07a3f0) the shardling moves smothly
### SOMBODY PLEASE TEST THIS (I think it was Apple's Changes)

Also, I am using a new 6 character number-letter combo like minecraft versions(e.g. 23w34a), so that I can name specific commits.
